# Simple Grocery Price Calculator
This Python program calculates the total cost of a customer’s grocery purchase. It stores grocery items and their prices in a dictionary, displays the available items in a formatted table, and allows the user to select multiple items and quantities. <br>
The program validates all user input using try/except to prevent invalid item names or negative quantities. It then calculates the cost for each item, displays a summary table of the items purchased, and outputs the total cost formatted to two decimal places.
