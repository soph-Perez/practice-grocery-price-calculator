# Simple Grocery Price Calculator

## Objective
The purpose of this assignment is to practice:

* Writing modular Python programs with functions
* Using a `main()` function to control program flow
* Implementing input validation using `try/except`
* Working with dictionaries to store and access data
* Formatting output neatly for the user

## Program Requirements
This Python program calculates the total cost of a customer’s grocery purchase. It stores grocery items and their prices in a dictionary, displays the available items in a formatted table, and allows the user to select multiple items and quantities. <br>
The program validates all user input using try/except to prevent invalid item names or negative quantities. It then calculates the cost for each item, displays a summary table of the items purchased, and outputs the total cost formatted to two decimal places.

## Expected Program Flow
1. Display available grocery items and prices
2. Prompt user for how many items they want to buy
3. For each item:
   * Ask for the item name
   * Ask for quantity
4. Calculate total cost
5. Display a receipt with all details
* Must run without modification
* No external files needed
